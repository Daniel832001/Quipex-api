In 3 hours I was able to impliment the CreateCompanyRecord and GetCompanyRecordByID endpoints. 

Due to my completionism and the fun of creating my first end-end applciation I added the last two endpoints afterward in less then an hour.
Roughly an hour and a half after that I was able to create an angular front end which can be cloned here: https://github.com/Daniel832001/Quipex-app


To set up the db, connect to ur local sql server via mssql. 
Create a new query using the CreateDb.sql script in the SQLScripts folder in the solution. 
Then create a query for this newly created DB using the CreateTable.sql script also in the SQLScripts folder in the solution.
