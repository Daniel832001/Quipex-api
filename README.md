In 3 hours I was able to impliment the CreateCompanyRecord and GetCompanyRecordByID endpoints. I was able to add the last two endpoints afterward in less then an hour.
To set up the db, connect to ur local sql server via mssql. 
Create a new query using the CreateDb.sql script in the SQLScripts folder in the solution. 
Then create a query for this newly created DB using the CreateTable.sql script also in the SQLScripts folder in the solution.
