The api only impliments a CreateCompanyRecord and a GetCompanyRecordByID. I only had time to add unit tests for the domain entity constructor.
To set up the db, connect to ur local sql server via mssql. 
Create a new query using the CreateDb.sql script in the SQLScripts folder in the solution. 
Then create a query for this newly created DB using the CreateTable.sql script also in the SQLScripts folder in the solution.
